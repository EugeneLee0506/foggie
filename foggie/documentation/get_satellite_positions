This document describes how to use the get_satellite_positions code, located in /utils/get_satellite_positions.py.
Author: Cassi

Description:
------------
get_satellite_positions.py calculates and saves to file the location of each satellite near the halo,
out to a distance of 5x the refine box width from the halo center.

See documentation 'halo_info_files' for a list of which halos, runs, and outputs this code has
already been run on.


Requires:
---------
You must have the correct paths set up for your machine in get_run_loc_etc.py.

There must exist an entry in /halo_infos/haloID/runID/halo_c_v for the snapshot you are running
get_mass_profile.py on. If it does not exist, see the documentation for get_halo_c_v_parallel.py to
obtain it.


User inputs:
------------
get_satellite_positions.py is designed to be run from the command line with command line options. You can do:
> python get_satellite_positions.py --help
to see the different command line options and what you can enter for each. If you do not enter
any command line options, get_satellite_positions.py will run with all the default options selected.
Here are the command line options:

--halo XXXX
Which halo? Default is Tempest (8508).

--run nrefXX_nrefXX
Which run? Default is nref11c_nref9f.

--output XXXXXX
Which output(s)? Options: Specify a single output (this is default and the default output is RD0036)
or specify a range of outputs using commas to list individual outputs and dashes for ranges of
outputs (e.g. "RD0020-RD0025" or "DD1341,DD1353,DD1600-DD1700", no spaces!).

--system XXXXXXXX
Which system are you on? Default is cassiopeia.

--local
If using system cassiopeia: Are the simulation files stored locally? Default is no. This option
has no meaning if the system specified is not cassiopeia.

--nproc X
How many processes do you want? Default is 1 (no parallelization), if multiple outputs and multiple
processors are specified, code will run one output per processor. If you are running on a single
output only, do not use more than 1 processor.

Outputs:
--------
The code creates one file per output called 'XXXXXX_satellites.dat', where XXXXXX gives the output
(e.g. DD1567 or RD0024). The columns of this file are:
sat_id (the satellite counter)
sat_x (x position in kpc)
sat_y (y position in kpc)
sat_z (z position in kpc)

Note that get_satellite_positions.py will output one file per output it is run on. These files can later be
combined into one big file, which is what is located in 'satellites.hdf5' in the halo_infos folder.
The satellites.hdf5 file has one additional column at the beginning, which is 'snap', e.g. 'DD1800'.

You can read the files output by get_satellite_positions.py in python by doing:
> from astropy.table import Table
> sats = Table.read('/path/to/table/satellites.hdf5', path='all_data')
Then you can pull out the satellite positions for only a single snapshot by doing:
> sats_DD1800 = sats[sats['snap']=='DD1800']
Then you can, e.g., print the location of each satellite by doing:
> for i in range(len(sats_DD1800['sat_id'])):
>     print(sats_DD1800['sat_x'][i], sats_DD1800['sat_y'][i], sats_DD1800['sat_z'][i])
