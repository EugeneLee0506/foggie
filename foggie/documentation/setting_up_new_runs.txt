Notes on how to set up a new run with all the bells and whistles
06/22/2018

In the ICs be sure these are what you want them to be:
StarMakerMinimumMass                     = 1000
grackle_data_file                        = /nobackup/mpeeples/enzo-with-grackle-with-self-shielding/grackle/input/CloudyData_UVB=HM2012_shielded.h5
you can't turn on self shielding until later (see below) but you'll
want the correct UVB file here  

From the ICs, stop it at z=15 and set
self_shielding_method       = 3
and restart. (technically, EUVB turns on at z=15.3, but close enough; this method breaks things badly if on before then!)
Now is also not a bad time to do
NumberOfOutputsBeforeExit = 1   ## so simrun.pl restarts every output; helps with memory leaks

You need a halo_track file. This can be different for the cooling
refinement region and the forced refinement region, but the format is
the same.

In the parameter file of the simulation you are restarting from:

## 7 = cooling, 12 = forced refinement. I think you have to have forced refinement for cooling refinment to work? so set both on.
CellFlaggingMethod             = 2 4 7 8 12 -99999 -99999 -99999 -99999 -99999 -99999 


change / define these: 
MustRefineRegionLeftEdge   = 0.493391 0.492903 0.497969 
MustRefineRegionRightEdge  = 0.499391 0.498903 0.503969 
MustRefineRegionTimeType   = 1
MustRefineRegionFile       = halo_track

UseCoolingRefineRegion    = 1
EvolveCoolingRefineRegion = 1
CoolingRefineRegionLeftEdge   = 0.493391 0.492903 0.497969 
CoolingRefineRegionRightEdge  = 0.499391 0.498903 0.503969 
CoolingRefineRegionTimeType   = 1
CoolingRefineRegionFile     = halo_track

For the edges there, take them from the halo_track files where the
simulation will be restarting. This will make things go MUCH faster
and possibly also not break because of memory --- it may try to refine
EVERYTHING ALL THE WAY EVERYWHERE initially if the edges are not defined.

And either now (or earlier at z=15 to keep things consistent) is a
good time to change
dtDataDump = 0.25 ## probably defaults to smaller; if you want DD's to match between runs, change this here
