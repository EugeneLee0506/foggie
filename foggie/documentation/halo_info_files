This document describes the different file types that can be found in the halo_infos folder
and how to use them.


The halo_infos folder is first broken into subfolders by halo ID, then by run type. For example, the
halo ID for Tempest is 008508, and the run type could be nref11c_nref9f.


halo_c_v
--------
Description:
These files are ASCII data files where the columns are:
redshift        snapshot name       xc      yc      zc      xv      yv      zv
where "redshift" gives the redshift of the snapshot, "snapshot name" is the file name of the
snapshot (e.g. RD0036, DD1534), "xc, yc, zc" gives the x, y, z coordinates of the center of the halo
as the peak of the DM density distribution, as returned by get_halo_center.py, and "vx, vy, vz" are
the x, y, z velocities of the center of the halo, as determined by taking a mass-weighted average
of the gas velocity in a sphere of radius 10 kpc centered on the halo center.

Units:
xc, yc, zc are given in physical kpc. xv, yv, zv are given in km/s.

Exists for:
8508/nref11c_nref9f snapshots DD0044-DD1926, RD0012-RD0034
8508/nref11n_nref10f snapshots DD0044-DD1630
5016/nref11c_nref9f snapshots DD0250-DD1763, RD0020-RD0030

masses.hdf5
-----------
Description:
These files are data files (that can be read with astropy.table) that give profiles of mass enclosed
versus radius for a number of different snapshots for a given run, all saved in the same file.
The columns are:
redshift    snapshot    radius      total_mass      dm_mass     stars_mass      gas_mass
where "redshift" gives the redshift of the snapshot, "snapshot" gives the name of the snapshot
(e.g. RD0036, DD1534), "radius" gives the radius at which the mass enclosed within that radius is
calculated, "total_mass" gives the mass of dark matter, stars, and gas enclosed within the
corresponding radius, "dm_mass" gives the mass of just dark matter enclosed within the corresponding
radius, "stars_mass" gives the mass of just stars enclosed within the corresponding radius, and
"gas_mass" gives the mass of just gas enclosed within the corresponding radius. There are 250 radii
at which the enclosed mass is calculated for each snapshot, from 0.01*refine_width out to
5*refine_width, log-spaced.

Units:
"radius" is given in physical kpc. "total_mass, dm_mass, stars_mass, gas_mass" are given in Msun.

Exists for:
8508/nref11c_nref9f snapshots DD0044-DD1926, RD0012-RD0034
5016/nref11c_nref9f snapshots DD0250-DD1763, RD0020-RD0030

Created by:
utils/get_mass_profile.py, which will output one "snapshot_masses.hdf5" per snapshot that can
later be combined. The masses.hdf5 file is the combined version.

satellites.hdf5
---------------
Description:
These files are data files (that can be read with astropy.table) that give the locations of each
satellite within 5*refine_width from the center of the halo at each snapshot, all saved in the same
file. The columns are:
snap        sat_id      sat_x       sat_y       sat_z
where "snap" gives the name of the snapshot (e.g. RD0036, DD1534), "sat_id" gives the number
(1 through however many satellites there are) to identify the satellite (NOTE: ID NUMBERS MAY
NOT BE CONSISTENT ACROSS SNAPSHOTS), "sat_x, sat_y, sat_z" are the coordinates of the center of the
satellite. Note that coordinates are *not* relative to the halo center, they are just the box
coordinates.

Units:
"sat_x, sat_y, sat_z" are all given in physical kpc.

Exists for:
8508/nref11c_nref9f snapshots DD0044-DD1630, DD1800-DD1926, all located within the same
satellites.hdf5 file in the halo_infos/8508/nref11c_nref9f folder.

Created by:
utils/get_satellite_positions.py, which will output one "snapshot_satellites.dat" ASCII file per
snapshot that can later be combined. The satellites.hdf5 file is the combined version.
