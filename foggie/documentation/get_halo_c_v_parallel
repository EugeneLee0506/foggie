This document describes how to use the get_halo_c_v_parallel code, located in /utils/get_halo_c_v_parallel.py.
Author: Cassi

Description:
------------
get_halo_c_v_parallel.py calculates and saves to file the halo center (as returned by get_halo_center.py)
and bulk velocity of the halo. This is so that the halo centers and velocities need only be read in
from file in the future, rather than re-finding the halo center every time.

See documentation 'halo_info_files' for a list of which halos, runs, and outputs this code has
already been run on.


Requires:
---------
You must have the correct paths set up for your machine in get_run_loc_etc.py.


User inputs:
------------
get_halo_c_v_parallel.py is designed to be run from the command line with command line options. You can do:
> python get_halo_c_v_parallel.py --help
to see the different command line options and what you can enter for each. If you do not enter
any command line options, get_halo_c_v_parallel.py will run with all the default options selected.
Here are the command line options:

--halo XXXX
Which halo? Default is Tempest (8508).

--run nrefXX_nrefXX
Which run? Default is nref11c_nref9f.

--output XXXXXX
Which output(s)? Options: Specify a single output (this is default and the default output is RD0036)
or specify a range of outputs using commas to list individual outputs and dashes for ranges of
outputs (e.g. "RD0020-RD0025" or "DD1341,DD1353,DD1600-DD1700", no spaces!).

--system XXXXXXXX
Which system are you on? Default is cassiopeia.

--local
If using system cassiopeia: Are the simulation files stored locally? Default is no. This option
has no meaning if the system specified is not cassiopeia.

--nproc X
How many processes do you want? Default is 1 (no parallelization), if multiple outputs and multiple
processors are specified, code will run one output per processor. If you are running on a single
output only, do not use more than 1 processor.

Outputs:
--------
The code creates a single file called 'halo_c_v', which is an ascii file. The columns of this file
are:
redshift
name (i.e. DD1356, RD0025)
xc (halo center x position in kpc)
yc (halo center y position in kpc)
zc (halo center z position in kpc)
xv (halo x-velocity in km/s)
yv (halo y-velocity in km/s)
zv (halo z-velocity in km/s)

Note that each time you run get_halo_c_v_parallel.py, it will make a new halo_c_v file containing
only those outputs you've run the code on. If you want to combine all outputs into one file, you will
have to do that separately.
