Mvir - summed mass of dark matter particles within Rvir IDed by rockstar as bound to this halo (Msun)
Mtot - summed mass of dark matter particles within Rvir as IDed by rockstar (Mvir_all), includes unbound particles (Msun)
M200c - summed mass of dark matter particles enclosed within the radius within which the overdensity reaches 200xrho_crit (Msun)
Rvir - virial radius as calculated by rockstar (kpc)
X,Y,Z - center of halo as calculated by rockstar (Mpc)
X_cu, Y_cu, Z_cu - center of halo as calculated by rockstar (code_length)
Center - numpy array of [X,Y,Z] (Mpc)
Center_cu - bumpy array of [X_cu,Y_cu,Z_cu] (code_length)
VX,VY,VZ - peculiar velocity of halo as calculated by rockstar (km/s)
Spin_DM_B - Bullock et al., 2001 spin parameter of dark matter particles as calculated by rockstar (dimensionless)
M_gas - summed mass of all gas cells within Rvir (Msun)
M_coldgas - summed mass of gas with T<1.5e4 within Rvir (Msun)
M_star - summed mass of all star particles within Rvir (Msun)
ContamFrac - fraction of Mtot made up of type 1 dark matter particles (dimensionless)
consistent_trees_link - all halos from the previous timestep that end up as part of this halo in the current timestep (array of halo objects)
consistent_trees_id - ID number of merger tree in tree_0_0_0.dat (dimensionless)

Note that rockstar is only run on type 4 DM particles, so all properties that come from rockstar are based entirely on those.
The current database includes all halos with at least 75 type 4 DM particles.
